# Neonix OS

Neonix OS is a lightweight, modular operating system designed for educational and experimental purposes. This project aims to provide a platform for learning OS development and exploring system-level programming.

## Features

- Modular design for easy extensibility
- Basic multitasking and process management
- Simplified file system implementation
- Clean codebase ideal for learning OS internals
